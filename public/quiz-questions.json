There are four forms of data binding(divided as 3 categories) which differ in the way the data is flowing.\n    1. **From the Component to the DOM:**\n\n        **Interpolation:** {{ value }}: Adds the value of a property from the component\n        ```html\n        <li>Name: {{ user.name }}</li>\n        <li>Address: {{ user.address }}</li>\n        ```\n        **Property binding:** [property]=”value”: The value is passed from the component to the specified property or simple HTML attribute\n        ```html\n        <input type=\"email\" [value]=\"user.email\">\n        ```\n    2. **From the DOM to the Component:**\n        **Event binding: (event)=”function”:** When a specific DOM event happens (eg.: click, change, keyup), call the specified method in the component\n        ```html\n        <button (click)=\"logout()\"></button>\n        ```\n    3. **Two-way binding:**\n        **Two-way data binding:** [(ngModel)]=”value”: Two-way data binding allows to have the data flow both ways. For example, in the below code snippet, both the email DOM input and component email property are in sync\n        ```html\n        <input type=\"email\" [(ngModel)]=\"user.email\">\n        ```"

The metadata is represented by decorators\n    1. **Class decorators**, e.g. @Component and @NgModule\n        ```typescript\n        import { NgModule, Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n        @Component({\n          selector: 'my-component',\n          template: '<div>Class decorator</div>',\n        })\n        export class MyComponent {\n          constructor() {\n            console.log('Hey I am a component!');\n          }\n        }\n\n        @NgModule({\n          imports: [],\n          declarations: [],\n        })\n        export class MyModule {\n          constructor() {\n            console.log('Hey I am a module!');\n          }\n        }\n        ```\n    2. **Property decorators** Used for properties inside classes, e.g. @Input and @Output\n        ```typescript\n        import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';\n\n        @Component({\n            selector: 'my-component',\n            template: '<div>Property decorator</div>'\n        })\n\n        export class MyComponent {\n            @Input()\n            title: string;\n        }\n        ```\n    3. **Method decorators** Used for methods inside classes, e.g. @HostListener\n        ```typescript\n        import { Component, HostListener } from '@angular/core';\n\n        @Component({\n            selector: 'my-component',\n            template: '<div>Method decorator</div>'\n        })\n        export class MyComponent {\n            @HostListener('click', ['$event'])\n            onHostClick(event: Event) {\n                // clicked, `event` available\n            }\n        }\n        ```\n    4. **Parameter decorators** Used for parameters inside class constructors, e.g. @Inject, @Optional\n        ```typescript\n        import { Component, Inject } from '@angular/core';\n        import { MyService } from './my-service';\n\n        @Component({\n            selector: 'my-component',\n            template: '<div>Parameter decorator</div>'\n        })\n        export class MyComponent {\n            constructor(@Inject(MyService) myService) {\n                console.log(myService); // MyService\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Angular v18 and above\n\n        import { Component, inject } from '@angular/core';\n        import { MyService } from './my-service';\n\n        @Component({\n            selector: 'my-component',\n            template: '<div>Parameter decorator</div>'\n        })\n        export class MyComponent {\n        myService: MyService = inject(MyService)\n            constructor() {\n                console.log(myService); // MyService\n            }\n        }\n        ```"

By understanding these rules, you can determine in which NgModule, Component, or Directive you should declare a provider.\n\n    #### Angular has two injector hierarchies:\n    ![Screenshot](/images/injector%20hierarchies.png)\n\n    #### Module injector \n    When angular starts, it creates a root injector where the services will be registered, these are provided via injectable annotation. All services provided in the `ng-model` property are called providers (if those modules are not lazy-loaded).\n\n    Angular recursively goes through all models which are being used in the application and creates instances for provided services in the root injector. If you provide some service in an eagerly-loaded model, the service will be added to the root injector, which makes it available across the whole application.\n\n    #### Platform Module\n    During application bootstrapping angular creates a few more injectors, above the root injector goes the platform injector, this one is created by the platform browser dynamic function inside the `main.ts` file, and it provides some platform-specific features like `DomSanitizer`. \n\n    #### NullInjector()\n    At the very top, the next parent injector in the hierarchy is the `NullInjector()`.The responsibility of this injector is to throw the error if something tries to find dependencies there, unless you've used `@Optional()` because ultimately, everything ends at the `NullInjector()` and it returns an error or, in the case of `@Optional()`, `null`.\n\n    ![Screenshot](images/hierarchy%20diagram.png)\n\n\n    #### ElementInjector\n    Angular creates `ElementInjector` hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element. `ElementInjector` injector is being created for any tag that matches the angular component, or any tag on which directive is applied, and you can configure it in component and directive annotations inside the provider's property, thus, it creates its own hierarchy likewise the upper one.\n\n    ![Screenshot](images/element%20injector%20hieracrhy.png)"

Create a component for subscribing service:\n        Let's create a component called UserProfileComponent(`userprofile.component.ts`), which injects `UserProfileService` and invokes the service method:\n        ```javascript\n        fetchUserProfile() {\n          this.userProfileService.getUserProfile()\n            .subscribe((data: User) => this.user = {\n                id: data['userId'],\n                name: data['firstName'],\n                city:  data['city']\n            });\n        }\n        ```\n    Since the above service method returns an Observable which needs to be subscribed in the component."

      "explanationMarkdown": "Below are some of the errors encountered in metadata,\n\n    1. **Expression form not supported:** Some of the language features outside of the compiler's restricted expression syntax used in angular metadata can produce this error.\n        Let's see some of these examples,\n        ```javascript\n        1. export class User { ... }\n           const prop = typeof User; // typeof is not valid in metadata\n        2. { provide: 'token', useValue: { [prop]: 'value' } }; // bracket notation is not valid in metadata\n        ```\n    2. **Reference to a local (non-exported) symbol:** The compiler encountered a referenced to a locally defined symbol that either wasn't exported or wasn't initialized.\n        Let's take example of this error,\n        ```javascript\n        // ERROR\n        let username: string; // neither exported nor initialized\n\n        @Component({\n          selector: 'my-component',\n          template: ... ,\n          providers: [\n            { provide: User, useValue: username }\n          ]\n        })\n        export class MyComponent {}\n        ```\n        You can fix this by either exporting or initializing the value,\n        ```javascript\n        export let username: string; // exported\n        (or)\n        let username = 'John'; // initialized\n        ```\n     3. **Function calls are not supported:** The compiler does not currently support function expressions or lambda functions. For example, you cannot set a provider's useFactory to an anonymous function or arrow function as below.\n        ```javascript\n         providers: [\n            { provide: MyStrategy, useFactory: function() { ... } },\n            { provide: OtherStrategy, useFactory: () => { ... } }\n          ]\n        ```\n        You can fix this with exported function\n        ```javascript\n        export function myStrategy() { ... }\n        export function otherStrategy() { ... }\n        ... // metadata\n        providers: [\n            { provide: MyStrategy, useFactory: myStrategy },\n            { provide: OtherStrategy, useFactory: otherStrategy },\n        ```\n     4. **Destructured variable or constant not supported:** The compiler does not support references to variables assigned by destructuring.\n        For example, you cannot write something like this:\n        ```javascript\n        import { user } from './user';\n\n        // destructured assignment to name and age\n        const {name, age} = user;\n        ... //metadata\n        providers: [\n            {provide: Name, useValue: name},\n            {provide: Age, useValue: age},\n          ]\n        ```\n        You can fix this by non-destructured values\n        ```javascript\n        import { user } from './user';\n        ... //metadata\n        providers: [\n            {provide: Name, useValue: user.name},\n            {provide: Age, useValue: user.age},\n          ]\n        ```"

Angular 2 is a complete rewrite of Angular1 version.\n        * The performance issues that Angular 1 version had has been addressed in Angular 2 version.\n        * Angular 2 is built from scratch for mobile devices unlike Angular 1 version.\n        * Angular 2 is components based.\n     3. **Angular 3:**\n        * The following are the different package versions in Angular 2:\n          * @angular/core v2.3.0\n          * @angular/compiler v2.3.0\n          * @angular/http v2.3.0\n          * @angular/router v3.3.0\n        * The router package is already versioned 3 so to avoid confusion switched to Angular 4 version and skipped 3 version.\n     4. **Angular 4:**\n        * The compiler generated code file size in AOT mode is very much reduced.\n        * With Angular 4 the production bundles size is reduced by hundreds of KB’s.\n        * Animation features are removed from angular/core and formed as a separate package.\n        * Supports Typescript 2.1 and 2.2.\n        * Angular Universal\n        * New HttpClient\n     5. **Angular 5:**\n        * Angular 5 makes angular faster. It improved the loading time and execution time.\n        * Shipped with new build optimizer.\n        * Supports Typescript 2.5.\n        * Service Worker\n     6. **Angular 6:**\n        * It is released in May 2018.\n        * Includes Angular Command Line Interface (CLI), Component Development KIT (CDK), Angular Material Package, Angular Elements.\n        * Service Worker bug fixes.\n        * i18n\n        * Experimental mode for Ivy.\n        * RxJS 6.0\n        * Tree Shaking\n     7. **Angular 7:**\n        * It is released in October 2018.\n        * TypeScript 3.1\n        * RxJS 6.3\n        * New Angular CLI\n        * CLI Prompts capability provide an ability to ask questions to the user before they run. It is like interactive dialog between the user and the CLI\n        * With the improved CLI Prompts capability, it helps developers to make the decision. New ng commands ask users for routing and CSS styles types(SCSS) and ng add @angular/material asks for themes and gestures or animations.\n      8. **Angular 8:**\n         * It is released in May 2019.\n         * TypeScript 3.4\n      9. **Angular 9:**\n         * It is released in February 2020.\n         * TypeScript 3.7\n         * Ivy enabled by default\n      10. **Angular 10:**\n            * It is released in June 2020.\n            * TypeScript 3.9 \n            * TSlib 2.0"

Interpolated content is always escaped i.e,  HTML isn't interpreted and the browser displays angle brackets in the element's text content. Where as in innerHTML binding, the content is interpreted i.e, the browser will convert < and > characters as HTMLEntities. For example, the usage in template would be as below,\n\n     ```html\n     <p>Interpolated value:</p>\n     <div >{{htmlSnippet}}</div>\n     <p>Binding of innerHTML:</p>\n     <div [innerHTML]=\"htmlSnippet\"></div>\n     ```\n     and the property defined in a component.\n\n     ```javascript\n     export class InnerHtmlBindingComponent {\n       htmlSnippet = 'Template <script>alert(\"XSS Attack\")</script> <b>Code attached</b>';\n     }\n     ```\n     Even though innerHTML binding create a chance of XSS attack, Angular recognizes the value as unsafe and automatically sanitizes it."

In this case, you need to prevent automatic sanitization in Angular by saying that you inspected a value, checked how it was generated, and made sure it will always be secure. Basically it involves 2 steps,\n\n     1. Inject DomSanitizer: You can inject DomSanitizer in component as parameter in constructor\n     2. Mark the trusted value by calling some of the below methods\n\n         1. bypassSecurityTrustHtml\n         2. bypassSecurityTrustScript\n         3. bypassSecurityTrustStyle\n         4. bypassSecurityTrustUrl\n         5. bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl\n\n     For example,The  usage of dangerous url to trusted url would be as below,\n\n     ```javascript\n     constructor(private sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {\n       this.dangerousUrl = 'javascript:alert(\"XSS attack\")';\n       this.trustedUrl = sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustUrl(this.dangerousUrl);\n     ```"

For example, you need i18n attribute for heading as below,\n         ```javascript\n         <h1 i18n>Hello i18n!</h1>\n         ```\n\n     2. **Create a translation file:** Use the Angular CLI xi18n command to extract the marked text into an industry-standard translation source file. i.e, Open terminal window at the root of the app project and run the CLI command xi18n.\n         ```bash\n         ng xi18n\n         ```\n        The above command creates a file named `messages.xlf` in your project's root directory.\n\n        **Note:** You can supply command options to change the format, the name, the location, and the source locale of the extracted file.\n\n     3. **Edit the generated translation file:** Translate the extracted text into the target language. In this step, create a localization folder (such as `locale`)under root directory(src) and then create target language translation file by copying and renaming the default messages.xlf file. You need to copy source text node and provide the translation under target tag.\n         For example, create the translation file(messages.de.xlf) for German language\n         ```javascript\n         <trans-unit id=\"greetingHeader\" datatype=\"html\">\n           <source>Hello i18n!</source>\n           <target>Hallo i18n !</target>\n           <note priority=\"1\" from=\"description\">A welcome header for this sample</note>\n           <note priority=\"1\" from=\"meaning\">welcome message</note>\n         </trans-unit>\n         ```\n\n     4. **Merge the completed translation file into the app:** You need to use Angular CLI build command to compile the app, choosing a locale-specific configuration, or specifying the following command options.\n\n           1. --i18nFile=path to the translation file\n           2. --i18nFormat=format of the translation file\n           3. --i18nLocale= locale id"

In this case, Angular sees only a fresh list of new object references and to replace the old DOM elements with all new DOM elements. You can help Angular to track which items added or removed by providing a `trackBy` function which takes the index and the current item as arguments and needs to return the unique identifier for this item.\n\n     For example, lets set trackBy to the trackByTodos() method\n     ```javascript\n     <div *ngFor=\"let todo of todos; trackBy: trackByTodos\">\n       ({{todo.id}}) {{todo.name}}\n     </div>\n     ```\n     and define the trackByTodos method,\n     ```javascript\n     trackByTodos(index: number, item: Todo): number { return todo.id; }\n     ```"

This is because there are no dependency services inside AppService.\n         ```js\n         export class AppService {\n           constructor() {\n             console.log('A new app service');\n           }\n         }\n         ```\n     2. The below AppService with dummy decorator and httpService can be injected in AppComponent without any problems. This is because meta information is generated with dummy decorator.\n         ```js\n         function SomeDummyDecorator() {\n           return (constructor: Function) => console.log(constructor);\n         }\n\n         @SomeDummyDecorator()\n         export class AppService {\n           constructor(http: HttpService) {\n             console.log(http);\n           }\n         }\n         ```\n     and the generated javascript code of above service has meta information about HttpService,\n         ```js\n         var AppService = (function () {\n             function AppService(http) {\n                 console.log(http);\n             }\n             AppService = __decorate([\n                 core_1.Injectable(),\n                 __metadata('design:paramtypes', [http_service_1.HttpService])\n             ], AppService);\n             return AppService;\n         }());\n         exports.AppService = AppService;\n         ```\n     3. The below AppService with @injectable decorator and httpService can be injected in AppComponent without any problems. This is because meta information is generated with Injectable decorator.\n         ```js\n         @Injectable({\n           providedIn: 'root',\n         })\n         export class AppService {\n           constructor(http: HttpService) {\n             console.log(http);\n           }\n         }\n         ```"

These are built around observable streams, where form inputs and values are provided as streams of input values. Let's follow the below steps to create reactive forms,\n     1. Register the reactive forms module which declares reactive-form directives in your app\n         ```js\n         import { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\n         @NgModule({\n           imports: [\n             // other imports ...\n             ReactiveFormsModule\n           ],\n         })\n         export class AppModule { }\n         ```\n     2. Create a new FormControl instance and save it in the component.\n         ```js\n         import { Component } from '@angular/core';\n         import { FormControl } from '@angular/forms';\n\n         @Component({\n           selector: 'user-profile',\n           styleUrls: ['./user-profile.component.css']\n         })\n         export class UserProfileComponent {\n           userName = new FormControl('');\n         }\n         ```\n     3.

They are suitable for simple scenarios and uses two-way binding with [(ngModel)] syntax.\n     For example, you can create register form easily by following the below simple steps,\n\n     1. Import the FormsModule into the Application module's imports array\n         ```js\n            import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\n            import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n            import {FormsModule} from '@angular/forms'\n            import { RegisterComponent } from './app.component';\n            @NgModule({\n              declarations: [\n                RegisterComponent,\n              ],\n              imports: [\n                BrowserModule,\n                FormsModule\n              ],\n              providers: [],\n              bootstrap: [RegisterComponent]\n            })\n            export class AppModule { }\n         ```\n     2. Bind the form from template to the component using ngModel syntax\n         ```html\n         <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"name\"\n           required\n           [(ngModel)]=\"model.name\" name=\"name\">\n         ```\n     3.  Attach NgForm directive to the <form> tag in order to create FormControl instances and register them\n         ```js\n         <form #registerForm=\"ngForm\">\n         ```\n     4. Apply the validation message for form controls\n         ```html\n         <label for=\"name\">Name</label>\n         <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"name\"\n                required\n                [(ngModel)]=\"model.name\" name=\"name\"\n                #name=\"ngModel\">\n         <div [hidden]=\"name.valid || name.pristine\"\n              class=\"alert alert-danger\">\n           Please enter your name\n         </div>\n         ```\n     5. Let's submit the form with ngSubmit directive and add type=\"submit\" button at the bottom of the form to trigger form submit.\n         ```html\n         <form (ngSubmit)=\"onSubmit()\" #heroForm=\"ngForm\">\n         // Form goes here\n         <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-success\" [disabled]=\"!registerForm.form.valid\">Submit</button>\n         ```\n     Finally, the completed template-driven registration form will be appeared as follow.\n     ```html\n     <div class=\"container\">\n       <h1>Registration Form</h1>\n       <form (ngSubmit)=\"onSubmit()\" #registerForm=\"ngForm\">\n         <div class=\"form-group\">\n           <label for=\"name\">Name</label>\n             <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"name\"\n                    required\n                    [(ngModel)]=\"model.name\" name=\"name\"\n                    #name=\"ngModel\">\n             <div [hidden]=\"name.valid || name.pristine\"\n                  class=\"alert alert-danger\">\n               Please enter your name\n             </div>\n         </div>\n         <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-success\" [disabled]=\"!registerForm.form.valid\">Submit</button>\n         </form>\n     </div>\n     ```"

This is useful for dynamic forms when you don’t know how many controls will be present within the group.\n           ```js\n            import { Component } from '@angular/core';\n            import { FormArray, FormControl } from '@angular/forms';\n\n            @Component({\n              selector: 'order-form',\n              templateUrl: './order-form.component.html',\n              styleUrls: ['./order-form.component.css']\n            })\n            export class OrderFormComponent {\n              constructor () {\n                this.orderForm = new FormGroup({\n                  firstName: new FormControl('John', Validators.minLength(3)),\n                  lastName: new FormControl('Rodson'),\n                  items: new FormArray([\n                    new FormControl(null)\n                  ])\n                });\n              }\n\n              onSubmitForm () {\n                // Save the items this.orderForm.value in DB\n              }\n\n              onAddItem () {\n                this.orderForm.controls\n                .items.push(new FormControl(null));\n              }\n\n              onRemoveItem (index) {\n                this.orderForm.controls['items'].removeAt(index);\n              }\n            }\n           ```\n           ```html\n           <form [formGroup]=\"orderForm\" (ngSubmit)=\"onSubmit()\">\n\n             <label>\n               First Name:\n               <input type=\"text\" formControlName=\"firstName\">\n             </label>\n\n             <label>\n               Last Name:\n               <input type=\"text\" formControlName=\"lastName\">\n             </label>\n\n             <div>\n             <p>Add items</p>\n             <ul formArrayName=\"items\">\n               <li *ngFor=\"let item of orderForm.controls.items.controls; let i = index\">\n                 <input type=\"text\" formControlName=\"{{i}}\">\n                 <button type=\"button\" title=\"Remove Item\" (click)=\"onRemoveItem(i)\">Remove</button>\n               </li>\n             </ul>\n             <button type=\"button\" (click)=\"onAddItem\">\n               Add an item\n             </button>\n            </div>\n           ```"

They allow you to define variable segments in the route path, which can be accessed and used by components and services. Path parameters are represented by a colon (\":\") followed by the parameter name.\n\n      There are three types of route parameters in Angular:\n\n      **Path parameters:** Path parameters are used to define dynamic segments in the URL path. They are specified as part of the route's path and are extracted from the actual URL when navigating to that route. Path parameters are represented by a colon (\":\") followed by the parameter name. For example:\n\n      ```typescript\n      { path: 'users/:id', component: UserComponent }\n      ```\n\n      In this example, \":id\" is the path parameter. When navigating to a URL like \"/users/123\", the value \"123\" will be extracted and can be accessed in the UserComponent.\n\n      **Query parameters:** Query parameters are used to pass additional information in the URL as key-value pairs. They are appended to the URL after a question mark (\"?\") and can be accessed by components and services. Query parameters are not part of the route path, but they provide additional data to the route. For example:\n\n      ```typescript\n      { path: 'search', component: SearchComponent }\n      ```\n\n      In this example, a URL like \"/search?query=angular\" contains a query parameter \"query\" with the value \"angular\". The SearchComponent can retrieve the value of the query parameter and use it for searching.\n\n      **Optional parameters:** Optional parameters are used when you want to make a route parameter optional. They are represented by placing a question mark (\"?\") after the parameter name. Optional parameters can be useful when you have routes with varying parameters. For example:\n\n      ```typescript\n      { path: 'products/:id/:category?', component: ProductComponent }\n      ```\n\n      In this example, the \":category\" parameter is optional. The ProductComponent can be accessed with URLs like \"/products/123\" or \"/products/123/electronics\". If the \":category\" parameter is present in the URL, it will be available in the component, otherwise, it will be undefined.\n\n      Route parameters provide a flexible way to handle dynamic data in your Angular application. They allow you to create routes that can be easily customized and provide a seamless user experience by reflecting the current state of the application in the URL."

NgRx is built on top of RxJS and follows the principles of reactive programming.\n\n     The main components of NgRx include:\n\n     1. **Store:** A single, immutable data structure that holds the entire application state.\n     2. **Actions:** Plain objects that describe events or user interactions that can change the state.\n     3. **Reducers:** Pure functions that take the current state and an action, and return a new state.\n     4. **Effects:** Side effect handlers that listen to actions and can perform asynchronous operations like API calls.\n     5. **Selectors:** Functions used to query and derive data from the store.\n\n     NgRx helps manage complex state in large Angular applications by providing predictable state management, improved debugging capabilities, and better separation of concerns. It's particularly useful for applications with:\n     - Complex data flows\n     - Multiple components sharing the same data\n     - Need for time-travel debugging\n     - Requirements for state persistence\n\n     Here's a simple example of NgRx usage:\n\n     ```typescript\n     // Action\n     export const loadUsers = createAction('[User List] Load Users');\n\n     // Reducer\n     export const userReducer = createReducer(\n       initialState,\n       on(loadUsers, state => ({ ...state, loading: true }))\n     );\n\n     // Selector\n     export const selectUsers = (state: AppState) => state.users;\n\n     // Component\n     export class UserComponent {\n       users$ = this.store.select(selectUsers);\n       \n       constructor(private store: Store<AppState>) {}\n       \n       loadUsers() {\n         this.store.dispatch(loadUsers());\n       }\n     }\n     ```"
